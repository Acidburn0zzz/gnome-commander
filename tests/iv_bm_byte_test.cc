/**
 * @file iv_bm_byte_test.cc
 * @brief Part of GNOME Commander - A GNOME based file manager
 *
 * @details In this file all tests are placed which belong to the
 * Boyerâ€“Moore string search algorithm, used in the internal viewer of
 * GCMD. Currently, only a single test is implemented in which a short
 * pattern of integers is searched inside a bigger array of integers
 * (see definitions in @link BmByteTest @endlink).
