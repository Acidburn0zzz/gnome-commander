<!-- DOCUMENT BODY ====================================================== -->


 <!-- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCING NAUTILUS  -->
 <chapter id="chapter1">
  <title>Introducing GNOME Commander</title>

  <para>
   GNOME Commander is a file manager aimed at people that wants a fast and efficent file manager.
   The program can currently perform most common file operations such as copy, move, delete, chown, chmod
   and so on. It can also detect changes to files caused by other programs and update the views without the
   need for the user to manually reload.
  </para>
  <para>
   The program also supports Copy&amp;Paste as well as Drag&amp;Drop. Draging files might not work to all
   programs but it's being worked on. The program also has some basic FTP support.
  </para>
  <para>
   Since this program is supposed to be efficent to use you are supposed to know what you are doing and
   the program wont bother you with to much "do you really want to..." dialogs. So be careful with what you do
   if you dont have any backups of your files.

    <title>Dynamic shortcuts</title>
    <para>

	 them at run-time. This is done by focusing a menu item with the mouse and pressing the wanted key combination.
	 This key combination should now appear right after the original text in menu item label.
    </para>
