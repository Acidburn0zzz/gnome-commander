Tips and tricks for GNOME Commander
-----------------------------------


1. Using a nice Nautilus icon theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default icon theme that comes with GC lacks icons for a lot of file types 
and only looks good at icon size 16. There are other themes around though 
that are more complete and looks better in bigger sizes. 
Unscalable Gorilla by Jimmac is a good example and can be used in GC by 
following theese steps:

    * Download Unscalable Gorilla from 
      http://jimmac.musichall.cz/download.php3?id=29
    * Unpack the theme to whereever you want.
    * Start GC and open the options dialog. In the Layout tab set the 
      Theme icon directory to be the folder where you extracted 
      Unscalable Gorilla. Also change Row height and Icon size to 20 or some 
      other size that you like. When you're done also make sure that the 
      Graphical mode is set to MIME icons.
    * When you now close the options dialog the file listings should refresh 
      and you should see Unscalable Gorilla being used.
	
This guide should work for all other Nautilus icon themes as well.
		
		
2. Handling archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
GC still lacks built in browsing of compressed archives. However the program 
can be configured so that working with archives becomes quite practical anyway.
This is how you do it:
		
    * If you don't already have the program Fileroller, download it from 
      http://fileroller.sf.net and install it.
    * Open the options dialog and go to the Programs tab. 
    * Add two favorite apps using the values shown in files 
      create_archive.png & extract_archive.png
			    
You can now right click any file or folder and choose 'Create archive...' to 
compress it and right click compressed files and choose 'Extract archive...' 
to extract it.

			    
			    
3. Using removable devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
If you use removable devices such as cd's, floppies and cameras a lot, you can 
make GC automatically take care of mounting them by following this guide:
			    
    * Open the options dialog and go to the Devices tab.
    * Add the devices that you are using. File mounting.png shows how I have 
      added my scsi cdrom. File dev_cd.png shows how the program looks with a 
      few added devices. In the last image circle A shows the available devices
      and circle B shows the button to press if we want to unmount the floppy, 
      which happened to be mounted. The icons that are used for the devices in 
      the example should be available in the 
      $(prefix)/share/pixmaps/gnome-commander/device-icons 
      folder on your computer.
