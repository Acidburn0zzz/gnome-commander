// General

* MIME configuration
* Browsing of compressed archives
* Tab completion at the built-in command line
* Splitting/merging files
* Write bookmark changes immediately to file
* Optional deleting to .Trash
* Unmounting a device via device button
* advrename & FAM: do not re-sort file list for every single renamed file
* Bookmark icons for ordinary folders in the device toolbar
* User defined categories for grouping bookmarks (Firefox bookmark folders)
* Editing remote files
* Optional file deselection after completed action (copy, rename, ...)
* More plugins:
    - creating tarballs from selected files
    - compressing/decompressing (gz & bz2)
    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (rotation, scaling, etc.) on selected files
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?
* vfolders for selecting files from arbitrary URI
  (visible file selection can be merged internally to the vfolder at any point,
   and then the usual multiple file actions can be applied)
* Manageable queue for file transfers (pause/resume/cancel & rate limits)


// Data presentation

* File names filtering
* Custom columns support
    - support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, icc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, video, ...)
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* Brief file listing (see mc)
* Thumbnail listing mode
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.


// Search tool

* File search - advanced criteria (according to file size, date or attr)
* Support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, icc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, video, ...)


// Advrename tool

* Support for file meta tags (icc, *ml, video, ...)


// Internal viewer

* Adding the toolbar
* Multiple files browsing
* Preloading consecutive images


Discussed stuff
-----------------------------------------------

* Toolbar configuration - OO.org like
* Light version of gc (based on gtk+ only - not depending on GNOME)
* Even lighter version of gc (statically linked, based on FLTK http://fltk.org/)
