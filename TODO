TODO
----
* The advrename dialog should have a feature to convert between
  upper/lower case.  
* Add authentication callbacks.
* The automatic creation of non-existing directories in the prepare-xfer-dialog
  does not work when the directory above the one to create doesn't exist.
* Add default dir to ftp-servers
* Add option to only apply style to the file-lists and/or find a way to change
  the cursor color in the cmdline.
* Fix the directory-pool?
* Add confirmation dialog before tmp-downloading large files
* Stop using GtkCList and other deprecated stuff.
* x-async problems only in debugger?
* Limit the number of updates/second in the file lists to avoid flickering. 
* Autoreload at focus-in events.
* Check if nautilus plugins etc can be used by gnome-commander.


Deeply wanted stuff
(but not doable ATM)
-------------------
* Browsing of compressed archives. Will be possible as soon
  as gnome-vfs gets this stuff working....
  

Discussed stuff
(not assigned to a version yet)
-------------------------------
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.
