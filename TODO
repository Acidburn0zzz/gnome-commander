TODO
----

* Documentation framework
* MIME configuration
* The advrename dialog should have a feature to convert between upper/lowercase.
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.
* Browsing of compressed archives
* Splitting/merging files
* Selecting text in browser
* Custom columns support
* Umounting a device via device button
* Internal viewer - multiple files browsing
* Support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, ...) -
  advrename + file-search + custom columns
* Brief file listing (see mc)
* File names filtering
* File search - advanced criteria (according to file size, date or attr)
* Shopping-cart for selecting files from arbitrary URI 
  (can be merged internally into visible file selection at any point
   and then the usual multiple-file actions can be applied)
* advrename & FAM: do not re-sort file list for every single renamed file
* Write configuration and bookmark changes immediately to file
* python plugins 
* More plugins:
    - creating tarballs from selected files
    - compressing/decompressing (gz & bz2)
    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (rotation, scaling, etc.) on selected files
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?
    - sending file as email attachment (configurable mail command)
 

Discussed stuff (not assigned to a version yet)
-----------------------------------------------

* Toolbar configuration - OO.org like
* Keyboard shortcuts configuration
* Light version of gc (based on gtk+ only, or fltk)
