TODO
----

* Documentation framework
* Toolbar navigation buttons: FIRST,UP,LAST
* MIME configuration
* The advrename dialog should have a feature to convert between upper/lowercase.
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.
* Browsing of compressed archives
* Splitting/merging files
* Selecting text in browser
* Custom columns support
* Internal viewer - multiple files browsing
* Support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, ...) -
  advrename + file-search + custom columns
* 'Brief file listing' (see mc)
* File names filtering
* File search - advanced criteria (according to file size, date or attr)
* advrename & FAM: re-sorts file list for every single renamed file
* Write configuration and bookmark changes immediately to file
* python plugins
* More plugins:
    - creating tarballs from selected files
    - compressing/decompressing (gz & bz2)
    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (retoation, scaling, etc.)
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?


Discussed stuff (not assigned to a version yet)
-----------------------------------------------

* Toolbar configuration - OO.org like
* Keyboard shortcuts configuration
* Light version of gc (based on gtk+ only)
