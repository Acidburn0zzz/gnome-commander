* advrename & FAM: do not re-sort file list for every single renamed file
* Bookmark icons for ordinary folders in the device toolbar

* More plugins:
    - creating tarballs from selected files

    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (rotation, scaling, etc.) on selected files
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?

// Data presentation

* File names filtering
* Custom columns support
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* Brief file listing (see mc)
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
