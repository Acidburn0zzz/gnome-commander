1. Introduction
--------------------------------
GNOME Commander is a nice and fast file manager for the GNOME desktop.

Read the sections "FAQ" and "Known problems" to see if there are some known
problems with the version you are using. The TODO file might also contain
some clues when running into problems.

The ChangeLog contains a detailed description on what has changed. For normal
users the NEWS file might be a better place to look since it contains
change summaries between the different versions.



2. Contributing
--------------------------------

Ideas:
  If have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program you
  should check the TODO file first before sending email. After that you're
  welcome to start a discussion on the mailing lists.

Cool hacks:
  * Send an email with the patch to the developers mailing list. It is
    preferred if you put the patch in the body of the mail rather then to send
    it as an attachment. That way it will still be viewable in archives etc.
  * Please use the -u flag when generating the patch as it makes the patch
    more readable.
  * Write a good explanation of what the patch does.

Translations:
  * Since this program now is in the gnome cvs tree, translations should be
    commited directly to the tree there.

Graphics:
  * Help on the default low-res mime theme (pixmaps/mime-icons) is very welcome.

Plugins:
  * If you have created a new plugin let us know about it on the mailing list.



3. Building
--------------------------------
This is a list of required libraries:

  * libgnomeui-2:
    Used for the graphics of the program.

  * gnome-vfs-2:
    Used for most of the file handling. If gnome-vfs is built to use fam
    gnome-commander makes use of that functionality by being able to update
    its visible directories even when files are create/deleted or changed in
    other programs.

  * libexif:
    Optional.

  * libiptcdata

  * libid3



4. Communication
--------------------------------
This project has two mailing lists, one for users and one for developers.
Subscription to those mailing lists can be done at:

users: http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-users
devel: http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel

You can also find email addresses of the people who have created gnome-commander
in the AUTHORS file.



5. FAQ
--------------------------------

[Q1] When will GNOME Commander support browsing of compressed archives?

[A1] This will be done when GnomeVFS gets it working. All file operations are
     done using this API so it would be very impractical to implement it using
     some other library.


[Q2] Some of the keyboard shortcuts in GNOME Commander are also used by my
     window manager, can they be changed?

[A2] Not at the moment, but maybe later on.
